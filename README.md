    What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
In this course we used different kinds of data models. These data models included Binary trees, hash tables and linked lists. We also learned how to incorporate these into applications and personally, I learned a good bit about myself and troubleshooting.
    
    How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
To approach the problem, I decided to learn more about the data structures themselves inside and out. This course forced me to go a bit deeper, and really understand the strength and weaknesses of each different data structure.

    How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
I hit a lot of roadblocks. Anytime I did, I went straight to Google. A lot of Youtube how-to videos helped me understand things a bit better, I learn a bit better when watching content -- so incorporating that in my troubleshooting process has helped a ton.
    
    How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
Before this project, I never really delt with algorithms at all. This is a bit more complicated than anything I've previously worked on, I feel it showed me that I am capable of doing a bit more than I thought.
    
    How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
With the complexity of these programs, it really forced me to clean up my code moreso than I did in previous courses. Without clean and readable code, it became really easy to get lost in everything. The harder it is to find/fix things -- the longer these assignments take and the more frustrating it is. So, just starting out with clean code is a major benefit.
